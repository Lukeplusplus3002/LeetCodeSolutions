# LeetCode Solutions
Each problem solution is stored in a `.cpp` file, with the following naming format: 
`<Problem ID>_<problem_name_in_snake_case>`
    
Within each source file, you'll find the link to the problem.

I include solutions that are fairly decent to me performance-wise, but keep in mind that I, as a *Homo sapiens*, can make mistakes when it comes to evaluating a solution's correctness and/or performance.
Note that I might include more than one solution in a single file if they seem equally good to me (mainly time and space complexity).
I also include solutions that have interesting logic and decent performance, regardless of whether they're the most efficient or not. If you could implement such solutions with better performance, I'd be happy to see a pull request.
